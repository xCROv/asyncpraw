Change Log
==========

Unreleased
----------

**Added**

- Add method :meth:`~.Subreddits.premium` to reflect the naming change in Reddit's API.
- Ability to submit image galleries with :meth:`.submit_gallery`.
- Ability to pass a gallery url to :meth:`.Reddit.submission`.
- Ability to specify modmail mute duration.
- Add method :meth:`.invited` to get invited moderators of a subreddit.
- Add method :meth:`~.Submission.award` and :meth:`~.Comment.award` with the ability to
  specify type of award, anonymity, and message when awarding a submission or comment.
- Ability to submit text/self posts with inline media.
- Added :meth:`.Reddit.close` to close the requestor session.
- Ability to use :class:`.Reddit` as an asynchronous context manager that automatically
  closes the requestor session on exit.

**Changed**

- :class:`~.BoundedSet` will now utilize a Last-Recently-Used (LRU) storing mechanism,
  which will change the order in which elements are removed from the set.

**Deprecated**

- :meth:`~.Subreddits.gold` is superseded by :meth:`~.Subreddits.premium`.
- :meth:`~.Submission.gild` is superseded by :meth:`~.Submission.award`.
- :meth:`~.Comment.gild` is superseded by :meth:`~.Comment.award`.

**Fixed**

- A bug where if you call `.parent()` on a comment it clears its replies.
- An issue where performing a deepcopy on an :class:`.RedditBase` object will fail.
- Some cases where streams yield the same item multiple times. This cannot be prevented
  in every case.
